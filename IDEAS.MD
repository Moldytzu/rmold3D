# Features/ideas to add/tweak
#
    - Create docs
    - Shadow casting
    - Better input system (implement controler input)
    - Make Windows & MacOS host builds successfuly
    - Prefabricates (Group of components bundled into a gameobject that can be easily instantiate)
    - Renderers separated into components (Cube/Plane/Point Light renderer)
    - Mesh/.OBJ renderer (render .obj file)
    - UI elements (Text, Input and Panels using Dear ImGUI)
    - Internal console (Need UI elements first)
    - Internal profiler (profiles different parts of the engine, monitors memory allocations (also when need to destroy the engine it frees them automatically), displays the collected data onto the screen)
    - Multiple light types (directional)
    - Editor (like UE4, Unity, Hazel or Godot)
    - Ability to modify the 3D resolution (render at a lower resolution then scale up to the window's)
    - Make experience better on low end machines (Ability to set the precision in the shaders to a lower one, downscale textures, cut down on texture quality)
    - Debug OpenGL calls/rendering (ability to add debug logs in shaders)
    - Support multiple texture formats (PNG,JPG)
    - Better component system (ability to make variables public using a std::map<std::string, std::any> named PublicVars exposed to the parent and to the game)
    - Cross-compiling for another platform from Linux (to Windows and Mac)
    - Better transparency (the trasparency/blend that opengl provides is kinda trash, maybe I can make my own algorithm??)
    - Ability to manipulate properties of a light object (using some helper functions as the public variables are not visible to pointers)
    - Multiple camera views (multiple cameras that are rendering to an off-screen buffer)
    - 3D audio system using OpenAL
